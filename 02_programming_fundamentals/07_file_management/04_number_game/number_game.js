/*
Let's go back to our game from yesterday where we displayed the number
of guesses. The goal is now to add some persistence to our game so that
it remembers the best score and the total number of games.

Be sure to update your original interface to display these numbers to
the player each time the game starts and ends.

It should look like this:

> node number-game.js
Welcome to the number game You played X games and your best score is: Y
