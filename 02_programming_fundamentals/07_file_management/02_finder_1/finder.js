    Open : to open the directory;
    Copy : to open a new prompt and to perform a copy of the directory into another directory;
    Move : to open a new prompt and to move the directory into another directory;

If you select a file:

    A menu will display the following options:

        Open : Read and display the content of the file;
        Copy : to open a new prompt and to perform a copy of the file into another place;
