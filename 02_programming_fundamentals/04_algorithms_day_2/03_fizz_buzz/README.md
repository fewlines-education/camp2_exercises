## Fizz buzz

Implement a fizzBuzz function as such: `fizzBuzz(list)`, where `list` is an array
of positive integers, for example : `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
This function will return a new array where some values will have been modified:

- if the number is divisible by 3: `Fizz`;
- if the number is divisible by 5: `Buzz`;
- if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 : `FizzBuzz`
- otherwise, the value is preserved.

### For example

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]` gives us :
`[1,2,"Fizz" 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz"]`
