/* Implement a fizzBuzz function as such: `fizzBuzz(list)`, where `list` is an array
   of positive integers, for example : `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   This function will return a new array where some values will have been modified:
   - if the number is divisible by 3: `Fizz`;
   - if the number is divisible by 5: `Buzz`;
   - if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 : `FizzBuzz`
   - otherwise, the value is preserved.

   YOU MUST USE array.map
